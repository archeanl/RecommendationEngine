#Movie Recommendation Engine 

My Movie Recommnedation engine works on data collected from movie lens Website.
My input data set is 1M movie ratings which are not in a proper format.

Apache Spark: I have used Apache Spark to process the data and list out few 
interesting facts like favorite movie, most watched movie, most watched super hero and other cool things. My project was an academic project that I worked on 
during my Master's degree. 

Since it had a deadline which I had to meet, After parsing the raw data set, I hardcoded the values into respective HTML pages.
I wish I could have used a real-time processing engine which shows the computations of the Dataset, but I did those computations before and after processing the results I hardcoded them into HTML pages.

The real interesting fact about the project was the use of Apache Spark, an engine to analyze the raw data files and to make sense of the raw data.

Please respond to me by email at archeanlokinindi05@gmail.com if you have any questions where you would like me to help you or contribute to the project.
